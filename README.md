Gardner ASP .NET Project


This is a web application being created as a test application for Gardner Business Media.
This project is being created by Drew Battison (Luckydog242).

The goal of this project is to create a simple Database and create a form using ASP .NET MVC C# to alter the database.
The project overview is attatched to the github.

Pardon the slowness and mistakes as this is my first time using ASP .NET and MSSQL Server.
